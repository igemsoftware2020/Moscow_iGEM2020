Kinetic model of the detection system with CasX. Description of the model and results you can see [here](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Moscow/Model)

We created a detailed kinetic model to ensure system performance, optimal conditions, reaction time, and potential sensitivity. The goals of the model are the following:
- To confirm our expectations of system functioning, such as the potential to detect nucleic acids in a reasonable time
- To determine optimal conditions (sgRNA initial concentration, CasX initial concentration, etc.),
- To determine detector sensitivity - the minimum concentration of nucleic acid in a sample that can be detected using our test system,
- To determine the time required to carry out one test.
